The web portals are being used to mislead users for political gains. Unreliable information is being shared without any fact-checking. Therefore, there is a dire need for automatic news verification system which can help journalists and the common users from misleading content. In this work, the task is defined as being able to classify a tweet as real or fake. The complexity of natural language constructs along with variegated languages makes this task very challenging. In this work, a deep learning model to learn semantic word embeddings is proposed to handle this complexity. The evaluations on the benchmark dataset (VMU 2015) show that deep learning methods are superior to traditional natural language processing algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Text-Convolutional Neural Networks for Fake News Detection in Tweets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Harsh Sinha"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1586083577,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586083577,"objectID":"52c1376441af60ebf45282eeafe3d76c","permalink":"https://sinhaharsh.github.io/publication/sinha2020audio/","publishdate":"2020-04-05T16:16:17+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/sinha2020audio/","section":"publication","summary":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) work surprisingly well and has helped drastically enhance the state-of-the-art techniques in the domain of image classification. The unprecedented success motivated the application of CNNs to the domain of auditory data. Recent publications suggest Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for audio classification. This paper aims to achieve audio classification by representing audio as spectrogram images and then use a CNN-based architecture for classification. The paper presents an innovative strategy for a CNN-based neural architecture that learns a sparse representation imitating the receptive neurons in primary auditory cortex in mammals. The feasibility of the proposed CNN-based neural architecture is assessed for audio classification task on standard benchmark datasets such as Google Speech Commands datasets (GSCv1 and GSCv2) and UrbanSound8K dataset (US8K). The proposed CNN architecture referred to as Braided Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) achieves 97.15%, 95% and 91.9% average recognition accuracy on GSCv1, GSCv2 and US8K datasets respectively outperforming other deep learning architectures.","tags":[],"title":"Audio Classification using Braided Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1548758928,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548758928,"objectID":"eb989cf61303ce75d6007f0c9f704a18","permalink":"https://sinhaharsh.github.io/publication/sinha2019upgrading/","publishdate":"2020-04-05T16:18:48+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/sinha2019upgrading/","section":"publication","summary":"Biometrics is being widely accepted for user authentication across the globe. Integration of biometrics in the daily life provokes the need to design secure authentication systems. This study proposes the use of outer ear images as a biometric modality. The comparable complexity between the human outer ear and face in terms of its uniqueness and permanence has increased interest in the use of ear as a biometric. However, similar to face recognition, it poses challenges of variation in illumination, contrast, rotation, scale and pose. Owing to the extensive work in the field of computer vision using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), its feasibility in the field of ear biometrics has been presented in this work. The proposed technique uses a CNN as a feature extractor and a support vector machine (SVM) for the classification task. The joint CNN-SVM framework is used for mapping ear images to random base-n codes. The codes are further hashed using the secure hash algorithm SHA-3 to generate secure ear templates. The feasibility of the proposed technique has been evaluated on annotated web ears dataset. This work demonstrates 12.52% average equal error rate without any image pre-processing, which shows that the proposed approach is promising in the field of secure ear biometrics","tags":[],"title":"Upgrading security and protection in Ear Biometrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1540982917,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540982917,"objectID":"4fe05005f91229ea44e58b0e0e4510e5","permalink":"https://sinhaharsh.github.io/publication/sinha2019convolutional/","publishdate":"2020-04-05T16:18:37+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/sinha2019convolutional/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a deep learning approach for ear localization and recognition. The comparable complexity between human outer ear and face in terms of its uniqueness and permanence has increased interest in the use of ear as a biometric. But similar to face recognition, it poses challenges such as illumination, contrast, rotation, scale, and pose variation. Most of the techniques used for ear biometric authentication are based on traditional image processing techniques or handcrafted ensemble features. Owing to extensive work in the field of computer vision using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), the feasibility of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the field of ear biometrics has been explored in this research paper. A framework for ear localization and recognition is proposed that aims to reduce the pipeline for a biometric recognition system. The proposed framework uses HOG with support vector machines (SVMs) for ear localization and CNN for ear recognition. CNNs combine feature extraction and ear recognition tasks into one network with an aim to resolve issues such as variations in illumination, contrast, rotation, scale, and pose. The feasibility of the proposed technique has been evaluated on USTB III database.
