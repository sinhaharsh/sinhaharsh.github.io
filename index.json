The web portals are being used to mislead users for political gains. Unreliable information is being shared without any fact-checking. Therefore, there is a dire need for automatic news verification system which can help journalists and the common users from misleading content. In this work, the task is defined as being able to classify a tweet as real or fake. The complexity of natural language constructs along with variegated languages makes this task very challenging. In this work, a deep learning model to learn semantic word embeddings is proposed to handle this complexity. The evaluations on the benchmark dataset (VMU 2015) show that deep learning methods are superior to traditional natural language processing algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Text-Convolutional Neural Networks for Fake News Detection in Tweets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Harsh Sinha"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1586083577,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586083577,"objectID":"52c1376441af60ebf45282eeafe3d76c","permalink":"https://sinhaharsh.github.io/publication/sinha2020audio/","publishdate":"2020-04-05T16:16:17+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/sinha2020audio/","section":"publication","summary":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) work surprisingly well and has helped drastically enhance the state-of-the-art techniques in the domain of image classification. The unprecedented success motivated the application of CNNs to the domain of auditory data. Recent publications suggest Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for audio classification. This paper aims to achieve audio classification by representing audio as spectrogram images and then use a CNN-based architecture for classification. The paper presents an innovative strategy for a CNN-based neural architecture that learns a sparse representation imitating the receptive neurons in primary auditory cortex in mammals. The feasibility of the proposed CNN-based neural architecture is assessed for audio classification task on standard benchmark datasets such as Google Speech Commands datasets (GSCv1 and GSCv2) and UrbanSound8K dataset (US8K). The proposed CNN architecture referred to as Braided Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) achieves 97.15%, 95% and 91.9% average recognition accuracy on GSCv1, GSCv2 and US8K datasets respectively outperforming other deep learning architectures.","tags":[],"title":"Audio Classification using Braided Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"}]
